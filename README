Library for accessing multi-function devices (networked photocopiers)
Copyright 2010 Adam Nielsen <adam.nielsen@uq.edu.au>

This library provides a standard method for remotely configuring MFDs.  It
includes an example command line application which both demonstrates how to
use the library as well as providing a convenient method for accessing the
library's functionality via the command line.

This library is still in the *very* early stages of development so is mostly
non-functional at present.

Installation instructions:

  git version only:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ cd src
    $ ./generate-gsoap
    $ cd ..

  all versions:
