Library for accessing multi-function devices (networked photocopiers)
Copyright 2010-2011 Adam Nielsen <adam.nielsen@uq.edu.au>

This library provides a standard method for remotely configuring MFDs.  It
includes an example command line application which both demonstrates how to
use the library as well as providing a convenient method for accessing the
library's functionality via the command line.

This library is still in the *very* early stages of development so is mostly
non-functional at present.

Currently supported devices:

 * Ricoh Aficio
    - MP5000
    - MP8000

Installation instructions:

  Prepare: (git version only)

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ cd src
    $ ./generate-gsoap
    $ cd ..

  Then git and other versions:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ mfdmgr --help

You will need the Boost C++ library installed before compiling.

This library and example programs are released under the GPLv3 license.  It
contains code from the gSOAP library which may be licensed differently.
